  "description": "A member of the Council and the Keeper of 'Nature,' the second concept created by the Gods. She has materialized in the mortal realm as a druid in a bid to save nature. She has Kirin blood flowing in her veins, and horns that are made out of the branches of a certain tree; they are NOT deer antlers. 'Nature' refers to all organic matter on the planet except mankind. It is long said that her whispers, as an avatar of Mother Nature, have healing properties. Whether or not that is true is something only those who have heard them can say. While she is usually affable, warm, and slightly mischievous, any who anger her will bear the full brunt of Nature's fury.",
